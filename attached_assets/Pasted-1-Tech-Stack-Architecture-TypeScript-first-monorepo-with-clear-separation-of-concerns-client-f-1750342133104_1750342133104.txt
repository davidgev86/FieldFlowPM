1. Tech Stack & Architecture
TypeScript-first monorepo with clear separation of concerns:

client/ for your front-end (Vite + React + Tailwind)

server/ for your back-end (Drizzle ORM config suggests a Node/Express or similar API layer)

shared/ for cross-cutting types and interfaces

Config files (tsconfig.json, vite.config.ts, tailwind.config.ts, drizzle.config.ts) are all in place — nice!

2. Documentation & Onboarding
Missing a top-level README.md. You’ll want:

Project overview & feature list

Prerequisites (Node version, database, env vars)

Install & run steps (npm install, npm run dev, migrations, etc.)

Deployment notes (how to push to Replit or another host)

Consider adding a LICENSE file and a CONTRIBUTING.md if you plan to open this up to collaborators.

3. Development Workflow
Linting & Formatting:

I don’t see ESLint or Prettier configs—adding these ensures consistent code style across client/server.

Testing:

No tests yet. At minimum, unit tests for critical shared logic and basic integration tests for your API routes will pay dividends.

Scripts:

Double-check your package.json scripts in both root and sub-folders. You might consolidate or add shortcuts for common tasks (e.g. npm run migrate, npm run test).

4. Back-End Considerations
Env Management:

Make sure to document all required environment variables (DB URLs, API keys, secrets) and consider a .env.example.

API Documentation:

Adding Swagger/OpenAPI (or at least a Postman collection) will make it easier to onboard new front-end developers or API consumers.

Error Handling & Security:

Ensure you have global error middleware and input validation (e.g. zod or Joi) on your routes to prevent bad data from reaching your database.

5. Front-End Considerations
Component Structure:

Keep components in client/src/components small and focused; use shared/ types for props.

State Management:

If you’re using React Context, tRPC, or Redux, document the data-flow patterns so it’s consistent as your app grows.

Styling:

Tailwind is set up nicely—consider enabling JIT mode (if you haven’t already) for faster dev builds.

6. CI/CD & Deployment
Replit Integration:

Your .replit file is present—great. You could also add GitHub Actions to run lint/tests on every PR.

Database Migrations:

Automate migrations on deploy, or provide clear instructions for running them manually.
