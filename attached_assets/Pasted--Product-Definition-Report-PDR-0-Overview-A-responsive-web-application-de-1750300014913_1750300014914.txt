**Product Definition Report (PDR)**

---

## 0. Overview

A responsive **web application** (desktop & mobile browsers) that gives small construction contractors an all‑in‑one workspace to plan, track and communicate projects while on‑site. *Not* a native mobile app; it must simply **work flawlessly from a phone browser in the field**.

Replit AI should choose the most suitable technologies, libraries and deployment workflow. **No tech‑stack guidance is included here by design.**

---

## 1. Purpose & Vision

Small contractors juggle multiple roles with little admin support and tight budgets. Existing software is either too costly, too complex or too limited. This product delivers the **clarity of enterprise tools at a price and simplicity that a 2‑10‑person firm can embrace**, cutting admin time, reducing cost overruns and impressing clients.

## 2. Core User Personas

| Persona                       | Primary Goals                                                                   | Typical Pain Points                                                        |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Owner‑Operator / Small GC** | Deliver projects on time & on budget; keep clients happy; avoid admin overload. | Disjointed spreadsheets, poor schedule visibility, surprise cost overruns. |
| **Project Manager / Foreman** | Know today’s tasks; log daily progress; coordinate subs.                        | Paper/whiteboard schedules, scattered photos, forgotten change orders.     |
| **Subcontractor**             | See schedule; receive updates; upload completion photos.                        | Late schedule changes, missing docs, unclear scope.                        |
| **Client / Homeowner**        | Transparent progress view; quick approval of changes; pay invoices.             | Endless texts/emails, uncertainty on budget and timeline.                  |

## 3. Problem Statement

> *“I’m running three remodels at once. My whiteboard schedule is outdated by lunch, clients keep texting for updates, and I won’t know if I’m over budget until my accountant closes the month.”*

The lack of an affordable, intuitive project management system forces small contractors into cobbled‑together spreadsheets, calendars and message threads, leading to schedule slips, cost overruns, lost documents and unhappy clients.

## 4. Product Scope (MVP)

### 4.1 Functional Requirements

1. **Project Dashboard** – list active jobs with status, budget burn, and next milestone.
2. **Visual Schedule** – per‑project Gantt or drag‑and‑drop calendar visible to internal staff & subs.
3. **Job Cost Tracker** – budget vs. actual table; pull actual costs from QuickBooks Online (one‑way sync at MVP).
4. **Change Order Workflow** – create, price and route for **e‑signature approval**; auto‑adjust contract total.
5. **Client Portal** – secure link or login showing schedule, photos, contract, approved change orders and outstanding balance.
6. **Document & Photo Storage** – per‑project folders; drag‑and‑drop upload; snap‑and‑send photos from phone.
7. **Daily Log** – quick entry of on‑site activities (crew, weather, notes, photos).
8. **Basic Contact/CRM Lite** – store clients, subs & vendors; assign to projects; simple lead list optional.
9. **Role‑Based Access & Permissions** – Admin, Employee, Subcontractor, Client.
10. **Notifications** – email (and optional SMS) when schedule changes, change order awaits approval, etc.

### 4.2 Non‑Functional Requirements

* **Responsive first**: Must render and operate smoothly on 6" phone screens and larger.
* **Usability**: New user should accomplish core tasks within 30 min, no formal training.
* **Performance**: Page loads <2 s on 4G; real‑time updates under 1 s.
* **Reliability**: 99.5 % uptime target; graceful degradation if offline briefly.
* **Security & Privacy**: All data encrypted in transit & at rest; role‑based access enforced server‑side.
* **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance where practical.
* **Scalability**: Support up to 100 concurrent projects and 50 users for a single company without degradation.
* **Cost Sensitivity**: Entry tier price point ≤ US \$99 / month for up to 3 internal users.

### 4.3 Out‑of‑Scope for MVP

* Full two‑way accounting sync (push bills/invoices back to QuickBooks).
* Native iOS/Android apps.
* Detailed estimating/take‑off tooling (CSV import acceptable for now).
* Advanced CRM automation, marketing campaigns.
* RFI/Submittal workflows (commercial‑grade features).

## 5. Key User Stories (MVP)

1. **Owner schedules project phases**
   *Given a new project*, I can build a timeline by dragging tasks on a calendar so that subs instantly see their start dates.
2. **Foreman logs daily progress**
   *At end of day on site*, I can add a log with photos from my phone so the office and client are updated without texts.
3. **Client approves change order**
   *When the scope changes*, I receive an email, open the portal on my phone, tap “Approve”, and the budget updates.
4. **Bookkeeper reviews costs**
   *Weekly*, actual expenses from QuickBooks sync into the Job Cost Tracker so we can spot overruns early.

## 6. Data & Integration Requirements

* **Accounting**: QuickBooks Online (OAuth2) – read Expenses, Invoices, Customers.
* **Import/Export**: CSV for estimates & contacts; PDF generation for change orders.
* **Email**: Transactional email service for notifications.
* **Optional**: Webhook/Zapier endpoints for future automation.
